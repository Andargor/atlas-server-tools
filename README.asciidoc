= ATLAS Linux Server Tools

(Work in progress)

This tool allows you to manage any ATLAS linux server without having to remember long commands.
It provides a lot of features, to get the full list check the https://github.com/BoiseComputer/atlas-server-tools/wiki/Command-Line-Usage[Usage] Wiki section.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ATLAS Server Tools requires certain packages be installed in order to function correctly.

IMPORTANT: If running under CentOS or RHEL, you will need the following packages installed:
```
perl-Compress-Zlib
curl
lsof
glibc.i686
libstdc++.i686
bzip2
jq
```

IMPORTANT: If running under Debian or Ubuntu, you will need the following packages installed:

```
perl-modules
curl
lsof
libc6-i386
lib32gcc1
bzip2
jq
```

Common prerequisites which should normally already be installed are:
```
>=bash-4.0
>=coreutils-7.6
findutils
perl
rsync
sed
tar
```

If using CentOS 6 or earlier, or Debian 7 or earlier, you will need to compile a newer version of glibc.
See https://github.com/FezVrasta/ark-server-tools/wiki/Install-of-required-versions-of-glibc-and-gcc-on-RHEL-CentOS

To use ATLAS Server Tools, you will need to install **SteamCMD** following this guide:

https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux

We assume you have created the `steam` user to store steamcmd and your ATLAS server.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow your ATLAS server to communicate with the outside you have to open some ports in your firewall: +
(Example port ranges for a 4 server grid)
```
5755X = Query Ports
575X = Game Client Ports (Leave + 1 space between servers until requirement is confirmed by Grapeshot)
3233X = RCON Ports
2700X = Seamless Ports
```



.#*2x2 Server Port Mapping Example (4 servers)*# +
TIP: _The Game Port +1 usage has not been confirmed by Grapeshot. Subject to change._

|====
|Server |Query Port|Game Port|Game Port +1|RCON Port| Seamless Port
|AtlasServer_01|57550|5750|5751|32330|27000
|AtlasServer_02|57551|5752|5753|32331|27001
|AtlasServer_03|57552|5754|5755|32332|27002
|AtlasServer_04|57553|5756|5757|32333|27003
|====

.How to open these ports on your Linux firewall:
```sh
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --match multiport --dport 57550,57551,57552,57553 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dport 57550,57551,57552,57553 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --match multiport --dport 5750,5751,5752,5753,5754,5755,5756,5757 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dport 5750,5751,5752,5753,5754,5755,5756,5757 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dport 32330,32331,32332,32333 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dport 27000,27001,27002,27003 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p udp --match multiport --dport 27000,27001,27002,27003 -j ACCEPT
```

NB: Change the ports according to the ones set in your `atlasmanager.cfg` file.

Install ATLAS Server Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install ATLAS Server Tools run this command:

[source,sh]
curl -sL http://git.io/fh4HA | sudo bash -s steam

NB: You may want to change the `bash -s` parameter to fit your steam user if different from `steam`.

This will copy the `atlasmanager` script and its daemon to the proper directories and will create an empty log directory in `/var/log` for ATLAS Server Tools.

To instead perform a user-install of ATLAS Server Tools as an unprivileged user, run this command:

[source,sh]
curl -sL http://git.io/fh4HA | bash -s -- --me

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stored in `/etc/atlasmanager/atlasmanager.cfg` and `/etc/atlasmanager/instances/<instancename>.cfg` you can find the variables needed to start the server, like the port numbers, the system environment variables and so on.

You will need to modify these files with any options you wish to give to the server, and any
paths that are non-standard in your environment (e.g. one common one is the path to the appinfo cache).

See <<Configuration files>> for options.

Also, in these files, you can specify any parameter you want to add to the startup command of ATLAS server.
These parameters must be prefixed by the `atlas_` string, some example could be:

[source,sh]
atlas_SessionName="My ATLAS server"
atlas_MaxPlayers=50
atlas_ServerPVE=False
atlas_DifficultyOffset=1

Your session name may not contain special characters (eg. `!![EU]!! Aw&some ATLAS`) as it could break the startup command.
In this case you may want to comment out the `atlas_SessionName` variable and define it inside your **GameUserSettings.ini** file instead.

To specify an option without an argument (e.g. `bRawSockets`), specify an empty argument (e.g. `atlas_bRawSockets=""`).

To specify a dash-option without an argument (e.g. `-log`), add the option="" prefixed with `atlasflag_` (e.g. `atlasflag_log=""`).

To specify a dash-option with an argument (e.g. `-StructureDestructionTag=DestroySwampSnowStructures`), add the option=value prefixed with `atlasopt_` (e.g. `atlasopt_StructureDestructionTag=DestroySwampSnowStructures`).

You can override or add variables for a specific system user creating a file called `.atlasmanager.cfg` in the home directory of the system user.

Each server instance must have its own set of ports.
These ports are specified using the `atlas_Port`, `atlas_QueryPort` and `atlas_RCONPort` settings in the instance configuration.
If the QueryPort or Port settings are shared between multiple instances, then the server will often either crash or hang
without being able to be queried.
If the RCONPort setting is shared between multiple instances, the server will hang at 0/0 players.

See https://github.com/BoiseComputer/atlas-server-tools/wiki/Configuration-Files[Configuration Files] Wiki for more options.

Install ATLAS Server
